<p>MIMCO AM, the French portfolio management company, is approaching the autumn with enthusiasm, announcing the appointment of Maximilien Lemme as Investor Relations Manager for the Grand Ouest region. Responsible for developing and nurturing a key B-to-B partner network, his arrival strengthens the existing distribution team with diverse expertise and a strong background in strategic partnership management.</p><br/>
<p>With over a decade of experience in finance and a successful track record in the SCPI field, Maximilien brings a wealth of knowledge and a particularly well-developed sense of contact to his new role within MIMCO AM. His professional journey includes substantial experience in real estate asset management and support for financial advisors across France.</p><br/>
<p><em>&quot;His acknowledged expertise and passion for the real estate sector will immediately establish his credibility with our partners, and already make him a trusted resource for our company,&quot;</em> says Christophe Nadal, co-founder and President of MIMCO AM. Christophe Coutteau, Group Business Development Director, adds, <em>&quot;Maximilien has in-depth expertise in real estate investment solutions</em><em>. His interpersonal skills, ability to work in a team, and eagerness to learn are key assets for success in his mission.&quot;</em></p><br/>
<p>His four years at Perial AM, where he held the positions of Manager and then Head of CGP Partnerships, enhanced his comprehension of real estate markets, on-the-ground knowledge, and honed his partnership management skills. Prior to that, he began his career in wealth management at BNP Paribas, where he held roles as a Wealth Advisor and B-to-B Professional Account Manager. He also played a pivotal role in the growth of Foncia Pierre Gestion as a Manager for CGPI Partnerships and Customer Relationships Manager.</p><br/>
<p><em>&quot;We are delighted to welcome Maximilien to our team. One of his strengths lies in his ability to adapt to the ever-changing real estate market and the evolving needs of our partners. We are confident that he will significantly contribute to the development and positioning of MIMCO AM,&quot;</em> comments Christophe Nadal.</p><br/>
<p>Maximilien holds a degree in Commercial Unit Management and also shares his real estate expertise as a lecturer at INSEEC, where he contributes to the development of the Master&#39;s programs in Wealth Management and Real Estate Markets, passing on his valuable knowledge to the next generation of professionals.</p><br/>
<p>Maximilien Lemme&#39;s appointment marks an important step for MIMCO AM, which continues to attract top talent to support its growth and consolidate its position in the French asset management market.</p><br/>
